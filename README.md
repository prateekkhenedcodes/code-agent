# AI Code Assistant ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the AI Code Assistant! ðŸ¤– This project is a command-line tool powered by the Gemini API, designed to help you with your coding questions directly from your terminal.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

Follow these steps to get the AI assistant up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites âœ…

*   Python 3.12 or higher
*   A Gemini API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation ðŸ“¥

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prateekkhenedcodes/aiagent.git
    cd aiagent
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    **Note:** A `requirements.txt` file needs to be generated from the `pyproject.toml` file.

3.  **Set up your API key:**
    Create a `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

### Usage ðŸ’»

To ask the AI assistant a question, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py "Your question here"
```

For example:

```bash
python main.py "How do I create a virtual environment in Python?"
```

## Calculator ðŸ§®

This project also includes a simple command-line calculator.

To use the calculator, run this command:

```bash
python calculator/main.py "2 + 2 * 2"
```

The calculator will print the result in a nicely formatted box.
